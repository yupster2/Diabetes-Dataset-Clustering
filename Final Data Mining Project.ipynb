    "#### We chose to analyze a data set called \"Diabetes 130-US Hospitals\", which contains data collected on Diabetes patients for years 1999-2008. The data was prepared to analyze factors related to readmission as well as other outcomes pertaining to patients with diabetes.  We felt this would be an interesting Classification problem, as we have prior knowledge that Diabetes affects some people of certain racial ethnicities more than others.  We also thought looking at factors related to readmission could be related to other factors such as other illnesses, number of medications being taken or age.  We will measure the success of our algorithm by assessing the objective function, which is minimizing the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE).  We will perform cross-validation to also assess the accuracy of our algorith and chosen methods.\n",

    "Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is an important measure of glucose control, which is widely applied to measure performance of diabetes care. The measurement of HbA1c at the time of hospital admission offers a unique opportunity to assess the efficacy of current therapy and to make changes in that therapy if indicated (e.g., HbA1c > 8.0% on current regimen). \n",
    "\n",
    "We considered four groups of encounters: (1) no HbA1c test performed, (2) HbA1c performed and in normal range, (3) HbA1c performed and the result is greater than 8% with no change in diabetic medications, and (4) HbA1c performed, result is greater than 8%, and diabetic medication was changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical model suggests that the relationship between the probability of readmission and the HbA1c measurement depends on the primary diagnosis. The data suggest further that the greater attention to diabetes reflected in HbA1c determination may improve patient outcomes and lower cost of inpatient care.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the decision to obtain a measurement of HbA1c for patients with diabetes mellitus is a useful predictor of readmission rates which may prove valuable in the development of strategies to reduce readmission rates and costs for the care of individuals with diabetes mellitus. The profile of readmission differed significantly in patients where Hba1c was checked in the setting of a primary diabetes diagnosis, when compared to those with a primary circulatory disorder. While readmission rates remained the highest for patients with circulatory diagnoses, readmission rates for patients with diabetes appeared to be associated with the decision to test for HbA1c, rather than the values of the HbA1c result."
